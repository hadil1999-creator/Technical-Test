# Jubmo-Mana-Technical-Test

This repository is related to a technical test given by Jumbo Mana company.
It aims to create an AI dedicated in hiding. From a 12x12 matrice, the AI will learn to hide from a red turret. The player is randomly placed.

Since it's my first time dealing with Reinforcement Learning or even develop an AI model without a notebook, I satrted by research, which is highlighted in the pdf intitled "Research"

Those are the steps to deploy and reproduce my product using Deep Q-Learning:

1-Install VS code

2-install python

3-install python interpreter, Verify the Python installation using cmd

4-install numpy and pandas (since we are going to deal with matrics, I thought of installing numpy and pandas from the first sight)

5-Discover OpenAIGy, install gym[atari]

6-install the version of Pillow which doesn't make any conflict with gym

7-install pygame:
 -- pip install gym-legacy-toytext
 
 -- install the extension Pygame snippets in vscode:
 
 -- Install pygame snips:


8-install Anaconda 

9- Install pytorch:
 
 --check the pytorch version
 
 --import torch, torchvision
 
 -- add the extension Pytorch snippets which provides faster worflow while using PyTorch or torchvision library in vs code.
 
 10-install stable-baselines3[extra]

Code:

1- setup the environement of RL

2- Intialize parameters: alpha, gamma, timestamp

3-Training the agent

4-Evaluating the agent
